# Python-Learning
Quick lesson references I use when teaching beginners coding.

- Start by creating a Virtual Environment. Makes it easy to keep track of Python package installs.

  - **python3 -m venv /path/to/folder/venv**

- Keeping Python code in PEP8 format is coding Pythonic Standard. I normally use autopep8. A nifty tool which automatically formats the code for you.

  - ```python
    pip install --upgrade autopep8
    autopep8 --in-place --aggressive --aggressive <filename>
    ```
